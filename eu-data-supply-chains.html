  <p>A reference table to record exchanges in data related goods and services involving European companies.</p>

  <p>Such exchanges are recorded based on documents made publicly available on the web.
    Typically these are press releases or list of customers posted on the web site of the company
    supplying the good or service</p>

  <p>When the exact time at which such an exchange began and ended are known, they are so listed.</p>

  <p>When they are not, the start date listed is the time at which I first became aware of the public
  document on which the existence of the exchange is mentioned.</p>
